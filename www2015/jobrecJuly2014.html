	   <p>
                    This is not the traditional corporate workplace. We give our employees the flexibility to manage their own schedules and work hours, the tools they need to do their work, and the opportunity to grow and to achieve.  We treat our employees like the highly-trained professionals they are.  We foster a collaborative and open environment, free of hierarchy. We all benefit from the wonderful results that occur when great minds work together to solve challenging problems.
</br></br>
We offer very competitive salaries and benefits.  Our pay structure is based on hours worked, not face time at the office, which means you'll earn more when you work hard, and have the flexibility to take personal time when you want it.
</br></br>
In return, we expect the highest level of performance and professionalism from our employees.
As a service business, our company depends vitally on the strength and capabilities of our employees, and succeeds only when we deliver excellent results to our clients.  We're looking for talented people who enjoy creative problem-solving, hard work, and can deliver results.

                    <h2>Job Description</h2>
                        
                        <p>This job requires an engineer who can manage working on multiple diverse projects simultaneously, with timelines varying from one month to several years. You will design and prototype a wide variety of custom MEMS devices, sometimes as project leader and sometimes as a team member. Typical project work consists of helping the customer develop a specification, developing initial concept designs, performing advanced MEMS design and modeling, process integration and mask layout, prototype fabrication (at UC Berkeley Marvell Nanolab, equipment training will be provided) and working with foundries to transfer technology for volume production. 
</br></br>
For projects that you lead, you will be expected to manage client expectations and communications, and to keep your projects on time and on budget. In our business, excellent project management is as important as doing excellent engineering work. You may also perform internal R&D, write proposals, travel to meet customers/suppliers, and represent the company at professional events. You will be expected to continually develop your engineering expertise and knowledge of all things MEMS.
</p>
